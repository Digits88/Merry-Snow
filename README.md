# [Merry Snow](http://merrysnow.cards/)
### 2D WebGl experiment using Pixi.js

## What's its purpose ?
Merry Snow allows you to send awesome interactive greeting cards !  
The user can create falling snow which stop on any element of the card (Yeah magic exists !)

This is an experiment and my first work with PixiJs.  
It combines Canvas & WebGl which allowed me to deal with a lot of particles and canvas' specific functions.

## What can I do ?
You can personnalize a lot of settings in your card such as :

1. Insert a personnal message
2. Change the font & style of your message
3. The size and the color of the snow
4. Change the background of the webpage
5. Include a beautiful picture of your dog
6. Set a transparent background on your image
7. Draw everything you want
